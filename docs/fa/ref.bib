  abstract = {Traditionally, IP network planning and design is mostly based on the average delay or loss constraints which can often be easily calculated. Jitter, on the other hand, is much more difficult to evaluate, but it is particularly important to manage the QoS of real-time and interactive services such as VoIP and streaming video. In this paper, we present simple formulas for the jitter of Poisson traffic in a single queue that can be quickly calculated . It takes into account the packets delay correlation and also the correlation of tandem queues that have a significant impact on the end-to-end jitter. We then extend them to the end-to-end jitter of a tagged stream based on a tandem queueing network. The results given by the model are then compared with event-driven simulations. We find that they are very accurate for Poisson traffic over a wide range of traffic loads and more importantly that they yield conservative values for the jitter so that they can be used in network design procedures. We also find some very counter-intuitive results. We show that jitter actually decreases with increasing load and the total jitter on a path depends on the position of congested links on that path. We finally point out some consequences of these results for network design procedures.},

This difference in delay is called 'IP Packet Delay variation.' The metric is valid for measurements between two hosts both in the case that they have synchronized clocks and in the case that they are not synchronized. We discuss both in this draft.},

  abstract = {This memo defines metrics to evaluate whether a network has maintained packet order on a packet-by-packet basis. It provides motivations for the new metrics and discusses the measurement issues, including the context information required for all metrics. The memo first defines a reordered singleton, and then uses it as the basis for sample metrics to quantify the extent of reordering in several useful dimensions for network characterization or receiver design. Additional metrics quantify the frequency of reordering and the distance between separate occurrences. We then define a metric oriented toward assessment of reordering effects on TCP. Several examples of evaluation using the various sample metrics are included. An appendix gives extended definitions for evaluating order with packet fragmentation. [STANDARDS-TRACK]},
